# simple-server

## install
```console
$ npm i simple-server -g
```

## usage

```console
$ cd [folder-path]
```

You can use flowing commands:

```console
$ simple-server 
```

```console
$ simple-server -p 3000 //Specify a port
```

```console
$ simple-server -h 'localhost' // Specify a host
```
Note:If you want to use host except for "localhost" or "127.0.0.1",you need to configure the host file first.
Because essentially it's always accessing local server.
