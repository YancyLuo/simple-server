# simple-server

## install
```console
$ npm i simple-server-l -g
```

## usage

```console
$ cd [folder-path]
```

You can use flowing commands:

```console
$ simpleserver 
```

```console
$ simpleserver -p 3000 //Specify a port
```

```console
$ simpleserver -h 'localhost' // Specify a host
```
Note:If you want to use host except for "localhost" or "127.0.0.1",you need to configure the host file first.
Because essentially it's always accessing local server.

The server also simply implemented some other functions: compression, range request and caching. My goal is practice, although they are not useful.ï¼ˆEnglish practice day day ðŸ˜‚ï¼‰
